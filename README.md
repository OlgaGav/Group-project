# What are you craving today?

## Description
This website contains contains a landing page where we implemented generating random image and random recipes and will continue generating different ones whenever user reloads the page. We also created a page for the user to search for recipes and a separate page for searching restaurant. Both of this page includes a search bar, search button, clear button. Searching recipe include sections for food list, recipe list on the right, and recipe instruction at the bottom. Inside the recipe list section, theres two buttons, one to take user to the search restaurant page with already generated restuarant base on the food selected, and also another button will take user to watch tutorial on youtube. Seaching restaurants includes a section for restaurant list, restaurant information, and inside the information, there will be a button to take user to the official website. Menu bar was also added to help with easy navigations. Inside the menu bar, there are links to click for example, "Search Recipe" that will take user to the page where user can search for recipe, "Search Restaurant" that will take user to the page where user can search for recipe, "Random Recipe" that will take user back to the main page to get random food recipes. 

## Usage
This Webpage we created is design for everyday user who likes to explore food that they havent tasted before and as well as recreate food with given instruction and recipes. This webpage help everyday user to search for food recipes and how to make it, as well as searching for restaurants locations. We also implemented giving user a choice to generate a random recipe instead for searching for them, giving the experience to try out new food. 

### 'Search Restaurant' page

Current version allow search of restaurants based on the user location, around ~ 2.5 miles (4km). 

**Note:** Getting user physical location comes under user privacy. HTML5 Geolocation API will always grant permission from the user to check geolocation. If a user allows, geolocation will work, else geolocation will be blocked.
